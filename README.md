# JSON_Project
Advanced Python - Plotting Australian Fires using CSV files, Plotly, and Scattergeo

This file includes many files relating to manipulating json and csv files and plotting the data on a world map using plotly. Files denoted with "eq" correspond to some practice files that were used to learn json file interaction. These files refer to global earthquake data.

For the project submission, there are 6 related files:
    aus_fires_jan_2020.html
    aus_fires_nov_2019.html
    australia_fire_data_january_2020026.txt
    australia_fire_data_november_2019331.txt
    australia_fire_map_jan_2020.py
    australia_fire_map_nov_2019.py

The two python files read data from the text files, manipulate the data, and produce the two html files that hold the plots of the fires in Australia for Novmber 27, 2019 and January 26, 2020.
